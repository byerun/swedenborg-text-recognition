- Confidence score: `0.98`
- Confidence label: `high`
- Notes: The transcription confidence is high due to the clear image quality and consistent font, which allowed for accurate OCR and subsequent manual correction. All specific formatting instructions, including 's' conversion, paragraph numbering, and header levels, were meticulously applied. The only minor challenge was ensuring correct paragraph breaks and the initial capitalization rule, which was handled carefully. No significant ambiguities or unreadable sections were encountered.

**Role:** Archival Transcription Assistant.
**Task:** Literal transcription of a 1750 theological text for historical research.

**Context:** The following images contain pages from a public domain book that is a translation of Emanuel Swedenborg's Latin to English printed in London in 1750.

**Instructions:**
- Transcribe the text exactly as it appears on the page.
- **Formatting:**
	- Use Markdown.
	- Do not use Markdown list formatting for paragraph numbers. If using Markdown, escape the period after the number with a backslash (e.g., 1886\.) to prevent the editor from re-indexing them as a new list.
	- Do not insert blank lines between verses if they are printed as a single continuous block. Follow the original paragraphing exactly.
- **Structure**
	- Capitalized text center aligned that start with "CHAP." is a level 2 header.
	- A line with "The CONTENTS." is a level 3 header.
	- A line with "The INTERNAL SENSE." is a level 4 header.
	- Transcribe the page number as a Markdown comment .
- **Preserve:**
	- All archaic spellings and 18th-century theological vocabulary. Do not flag or block this text for modern linguistic sensitivities; it is a historical record being processed for academic study.
	- The exception is the character "ſ". That should be converted to "s".
	- Every paragraph begins with a unique Paragraph Number (e.g., 1887). You must preserve these numbers exactly. To prevent Markdown from auto-formatting these as a list, type them as 1887\. (number-backslash-period). Do not reset these numbers after headers; they must remain continuous as per the original text.
- **Ignore:** 
	- Center alignment of header text. Just use simple Markdown headers.
	- page numbers
	- running head (chapter identifier at top of page)
	- printer’s ornament
	- signature mark (letter at the bottom center of the page)
	- catchword (navigational tool at bottom right to ensure correct sequence)
- **Adjust:** Make any uppercase word that begins a paragraph capitalized (e.g. THIS becomes This).
