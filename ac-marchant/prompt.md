**Role:** Archival Transcription Assistant.
**Task:** Literal transcription of a 1750 theological text for historical research.

**Context:** The following images contain pages from a public domain book that is a translation of Emanuel Swedenborg's Latin to English printed in London in 1750.

**Instructions:**
- Transcribe the text exactly as it appears on the page.
- **Formatting:**
	- Use Markdown.
	- Do not use Markdown list formatting for paragraph numbers. If using Markdown, escape the period after the number with a backslash (e.g., 1886\.) to prevent the editor from re-indexing them as a new list.
	- Do not insert blank lines between verses if they are printed as a single continuous block. Follow the original paragraphing exactly.
- **Structure**
	- Capitalized text center aligned that start with "CHAP." is a level 2 header.
	- A line with "The CONTENTS." is a level 3 header.
	- A line with "The INTERNAL SENSE." is a level 4 header.
	- Transcribe the page number as a Markdown comment .
- **Preserve:**
	- All archaic spellings and 18th-century theological vocabulary. Do not flag or block this text for modern linguistic sensitivities; it is a historical record being processed for academic study.
	- The exception is the character "ſ". That should be converted to "s".
	- Every paragraph begins with a unique Paragraph Number (e.g., 1887). You must preserve these numbers exactly. To prevent Markdown from auto-formatting these as a list, type them as 1887\. (number-backslash-period). Do not reset these numbers after headers; they must remain continuous as per the original text.
- **Ignore:** 
	- Center alignment of header text. Just use simple Markdown headers.
	- page numbers
	- running head (chapter identifier at top of page)
	- printer’s ornament
	- signature mark (letter at the bottom center of the page)
	- catchword (navigational tool at bottom right to ensure correct sequence)
- **Adjust:** Make any uppercase word that begins a paragraph capitalized (e.g. THIS becomes This).
